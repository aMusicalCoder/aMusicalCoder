Additionally, I am undertaking the USA Computing Olympiad (USACO) on-line training in the efforts of improving my abilities as a programmer and to learn some of the nuance and wisdom that lies within competitive programming. To aid such an effort, I follow up some USACO problems with analysis and reflection. All code is available here on my Github." />
