title: Games I Made in High School
---
Most of my self-taught knowledge of programming came from developing games throughout my childhood. When I was 8, I started out by making text-based adventure games in C++. I followed along with all the game development books I could find (my dad had a lot lying around) and found a deep passion for programming in the process. The only remnants I have found in all these years of playing with code are as follows:

## Amorphous Arena:

RTS game I created from scratch in under 48 hours for the Ludum Dare 35 game developer competition. 
Created only using C++ and the graphics library SDL.

## Business Simulator:

Small and unfinished web game I started to work on in HTML, CSS, and JS.
Not much to show off here, but I left it in for archive purposes.

## Chapman's Adventure:
    
Unfinished top-down adventure game. Created using C++ and the graphics library SFML.
Basic graphics engine implemented but nothing further.

## Swipe It! (2014-2015)
    
First iteration of a mobile-game I had worked on over multiple years. Created with Action-Script 3.0 and the Starling Framework.
You swipe across an arrow that appears on the screen in a random direction.
Your goal is to get as many swipes as you can before the delay between your swipes becomes too long. 

## Swipe It! (2016)
    
Final iteration of Swipe It!.
The graphics have been greatly improved, with animations too.
The main game mechanics has been improved, with power-ups and a surrounding story. You are trying to keep a generator running.
The geometric arrow has been replaced with a wire.

## Worm Fishing(2014):

Unfinished game where worms float to the sky and you have to flip a bucket with "realistic" physics to catch them.
Bucket physics fully functional at the point of abandonment.
