With this blog, I intend to chronicle the progress I make with my personal projects. This will be mainly be for documentation purposes but will also serve to further establish my credibility as I gain more experience.

Some such projects are as follows:

* Finishing my Modal Improvisation Practice Tool website.
* Tonearm Rewiring of an Onkyo CP-1040F Turntable.
* Learning x86 Assembly Language and reading *The Zen of Assembly Language*.
