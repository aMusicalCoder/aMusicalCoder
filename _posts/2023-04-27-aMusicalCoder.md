This website serves the purpose of my personal portfolio and blog. The particle effects are created using JSON and the particles.js library. The animations use the animate.css library. The rest of the front-end is HTML/CSS/JS, with markdown content served via Jekyll(Ruby) and hosted on Github Pages. Despite using Jekyll to serve content, I did not use any templates or layouts as per a typical Jekyll website. This is because I wanted the entire website to be on a single page so as not to interrupt the particle effect or any of the animations. All code is available [here](https://github.com/aMusicalCoder) on my Github.
