title: Python Scripting and USACO Training
---
Over the course of my career in Tech, I have created various python scripts to serve specific purposes.
For example, while working help-desk at Pine-Richland School District, I created a script to automate csv formatting for a mass e-mail, and one to automate csv formatting for a mass letter containing standardized testing information.
Additionally, I am undertaking the USA Computing Olympiad (USACO) on-line training in the efforts of improving my abilities as a programmer and to learn some of the nuance and wisdom that lies within competitive programming. To aid such an effort, I follow up some USACO problems with analysis and reflection.
All code is available [here](https://github.com/aMusicalCoder) on my Github.
